Example:

nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
We want to find the majority element ‚Äî the one that appears more than ‚åän / 2‚åã times.
In this case, the length n = 7, so we are looking for the element that appears > 3 times.

üîÅ Step-by-Step Execution:
| Index | nums [i] | majority | vote | Action                                                              |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 2        | 2        | 1    | Initialize with first element                                       |
| 1     | 2        | 2        | 2    | Same as majority ‚Üí vote++                                           |
| 2     | 1        | 2        | 1    | Different from majority ‚Üí vote--                                    |
| 3     | 1        | 2        | 0    | Different again ‚Üí vote--, becomes 0 ‚Üí new candidate in next step    |
| 4     | 1        | 1        | 1    | vote was 0 ‚Üí set majority = 1, vote = 1                             |
| 5     | 2        | 1        | 0    | Different from majority ‚Üí vote--, becomes 0 ‚Üí new candidate in next |
| 6     | 2        | 2        | 1    | vote was 0 ‚Üí set majority = 2, vote = 1                             |


‚úÖ Final Output:
return majority = 2;
